pyenv tries to maintain compatibility with Unix platforms (and, where possible, emulators like WSL).

While we will not try to explicitly break backwards-compatibility, we cannot support older platforms. We may try to maintain compatibility for at least the period covered by the appropriate extended support period of the platform. This is subject to change at any time.
